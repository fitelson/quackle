# QuackleScrabble

Multiplatform (iOS + macOS) Scrabble game powered by the Quackle C++ engine.

## Build

```bash
# iOS Simulator
xcodebuild -project QuackleScrabble.xcodeproj -scheme QuackleScrabble -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build

# macOS (needs -allowProvisioningUpdates for Game Center entitlement)
xcodebuild -project QuackleScrabble.xcodeproj -scheme QuackleScrabble -destination 'platform=macOS' -allowProvisioningUpdates build
```

## Project structure

- `QuackleScrabble/App/` — ContentView, GameView, HandoffView, WaitingForOpponentView, sheet views (BlankPicker, History, TopMoves, SkillSlider)
- `QuackleScrabble/Bridge/` — QuackleEngine.swift (main Observable engine), QuackleBridge (Obj-C++ bridge to C++ Quackle)
- `QuackleScrabble/Views/Board/` — BoardView, SquareView
- `QuackleScrabble/Views/Rack/` — RackView
- `QuackleScrabble/Model/` — GameState (TilePlacement, MoveHistoryEntry, AIAnimTile, SavedGameState)
- `QuackleScrabble/Views/Game/` — OpponentRackView, AIAnimationOverlay, ScoreboardView, MoveInputView, ModeSelectionView
- `QuackleScrabble/Multiplayer/` — GameCenterManager, MultiplayerGameState
- `QuackleScrabble/QuackleScrabble.entitlements` — Game Center capability

## Key conventions

- Tile placement uses immediate DragGesture (not tap-to-place or system onDrag/onDrop)
- The "game" named coordinate space is defined on GameView's VStack and used by all drag gestures
- Board geometry (grid origin, square size, zoom state) is reported to the engine for drop-target calculation
- Drag-and-drop is zoom-aware: endDrag() inverse-transforms coordinates through scaleEffect + offset
- Rack tiles can be reordered by dragging within the rack (animated live preview)
- Game state persists across launches via UserDefaults (auto-saves after each move)
- LetterString is FixedLengthString (max 40 chars); use LongLetterString (std::string) for bag-sized data
- Bag() default constructor calls prepareFullBag(); always call clear() before toss() when restoring
- Bundle ID: `com.bef.quacklescrabble`
- Lexicon: CSW19
- GameMode enum: .ai (vs computer), .multiplayer (via Game Center), .passAndPlay (two humans, one device)
- Multiplayer uses GKTurnBasedMatch with programmatic auto-match (GKTurnBasedMatch.find(for:)), no matchmaker UI
- findOrCreateMatch() cleans up stale matches, resumes active ones, or starts programmatic auto-match
- Only the currentParticipant initializes a new match; the other player waits for first move
- Opponent display names resolved from match participants when loading state (handles late-join)
- GameCenterManager conforms to GKLocalPlayerListener for turn event callbacks
- QuackleEngine.onMultiplayerMoveCommitted callback wired in QuackleScrabbleApp to submit turns
- Pass & Play uses HandoffView overlay between turns to hide the rack during device handoff
- Bridge has separate methods for AI games (startNewGame/restoreGame) and two-human games (startNewTwoHumanGame/restoreTwoHumanGame)
- Game state persistence (UserDefaults) only applies to AI mode; multiplayer state lives in GameKit match data
- ModeSelectionView shown on first launch (no saved game) or when user taps New
